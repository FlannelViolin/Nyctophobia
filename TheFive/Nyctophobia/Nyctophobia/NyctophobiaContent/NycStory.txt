Tomorrow was our anniversary.
Or maybe it's today now...
2
I want to see her again,
but for now I'll settle 
for getting closer to her
3
Am I even getting closer 
to her? Phoebe? Maybe?
4
Phoebe is the only name
I remember anymore
Hope it's her name
5
I think I can hear
her crying for help
6
This house swallows light
and drains energy
my poor Phoebe...
7
These rooms, light their
floors. Happy squares of
white. Hope is given.
8
Next room, gray gray gray
Will the darkness get me
this time? gray, gray...
9
The door is so far away
the bright tiles no hope
only false.
10
Phoebe, did the gray...
gray get you?
11
There's so much gray here
These puzzles are...
gray
